' Developer Express Code Central Example:
' Prism - How to define Prism regions for various DXDocking elements
' 
' Since Prism RegionManager supports standard controls only, it is necessary to
' write custom RegionAdapters (a descendant of the
' Microsoft.Practices.Prism.Regions.RegionAdapterBase class) in order to instruct
' Prism RegionManager how to deal with DXDocking elements.
' 
' This example covers
' the following scenarios:
' 
' Using a LayoutPanel as a Prism region. The
' LayoutPanelAdapter class creates a new ContentControl containing a View and then
' places it into a target LayoutPanel.
' Using a LayoutGroup as a Prism region. The
' LayoutGroupAdapter creates a new LayoutPanel containing a View, and then adds it
' to a target LayoutGroup’s Items collection,
' Using a DocumentGroup as a Prism
' region. The DocumentGroupAdapter behaves similarly to the LayoutGroupAdapter.
' The only difference is that it manipulates DocumentPanels.
'
